# - Find CppUTest
# This module finds if CppUTest is installed and determines where the include
# files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is.
# This code sets the following variables:
#
# CPPUTEST_FOUND        = CppUTest is installed
# CPPUTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS = CppUTest include directory
# CPPUTEST_LIBRARIES    = Link options to compile with CppUTest
