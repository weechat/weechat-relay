# - Find Readline
# This module finds if Readline is installed and determines where the include
# files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is.
# This code sets the following variables:
#
# READLINE_FOUND        = Readline is installed
# READLINE_INCLUDE_DIRS = Readline include directory
# READLINE_LIBRARIES    = Link options to compile with Readline
