WeeChat Relay is a C library to communicate between WeeChat and a client using
the "weechat" relay protocol.

[IMPORTANT]
This library is under development, there is no stable version yet. +
*DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!*

Homepage: https://weechat.org/

== Features

* Communication between WeeChat and a client:
** from client to WeeChat: build and send commands, decode binary messages
   received from WeeChat
** from WeeChat to client: build and send binary messages.
* Command-line interface to the WeeChat Relay library (`weechat-relay-cli`),
  which can be used for tests, debug or in shell scripts.

== Install

=== Dependencies

Following packages are *required*:

* CMake
* GnuTLS
* GNU Readline (for `weechat-relay-cli`)
* zlib

=== Compile

* Installation in system directories (requires _root_ privileges):

----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
----

* Installation in custom directory (for example your home):

----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/directory ..
$ make
$ make install
----

=== Run tests

Following packages are *required* to compile tests:

* libcpputest-dev
* C++ compiler

Tests must be enabled when compiling WeeChat Relay:

----
$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
----

They can be launched after compilation from the build directory:

----
$ ctest -V
----

== Command-line interface

The binary `weechat-relay-cli` can be used to debug communication between
a client and WeeChat relay.
