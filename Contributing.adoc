== Reporting bugs

First, some basic things:

* Use only English to communicate with developers.
* Search in issues if the same problem or feature request has already been
  reported (a duplicate is waste of time for you and the developers!).
* If you can, please check if the problem has been fixed in development version
  (if you are using a stable release or old version).
* Report only one bug or feature request per issue.

=== Security reports

Please *DO NOT* file a GitHub issue for security related problems, but send an
email to <security@weechat.org> instead.

=== Required info

When reporting https://github.com/weechat/weechat-relay/issues[issues] on GitHub,
please include:

* The *library version*: output of `weechat-relay-cli -v`
* The *version of the remote WeeChat*: the output of `/v` in WeeChat,
  for example: _WeeChat 2.5-dev (git: v2.4-67-g413221bc9)_. +
* Your *operating system*: its name and version (examples: Linux Debian Bullseye,
  FreeBSD 13.0, Windows/Cygwin 64-bit, Windows/Ubuntu 64-bit...).
* The *steps to reproduce*: if possible, please include a reproducible example:
  explain the steps which led you to the problem.
* The *gdb's backtrace* (only for a crash): if you can reproduce the crash
  (or if you have a core file), please include the backtrace from gdb.
* The *actual result*.
* The *expected result*: the correct result you are expecting.

== Feature requests

WeeChat Relay is under active development, so your idea may already have been
implemented, or scheduled for a future version (you can check in
https://github.com/weechat/weechat-relay/milestones[milestones] on GitHub).

Pull requests on GitHub are welcome for minor new features.

For major new features, it's better to discuss about it in IRC
(server: _chat.freenode.net_, channel _#weechat_).

Before submitting any pull request, be sure you have read the
https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_dev.en.html#coding_rules[coding rules]
in WeeChat Developer's guide, which contains info about styles used, naming
convention and other useful info.
