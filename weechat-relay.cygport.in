# This file is used to build Cygwin packages using the "cygport" command.
#
# It must be used *ONLY* for a stable release (version "X.Y.Z"),
# not for a development version (version "X.Y.Z-dev" or "X.Y.Z-rcN").
#
# Instructions:
#
#   1. install asciidoctor (to build man page/docs):
#
#      $ gem install -n /usr/local/bin asciidoctor
#
#   2. execute these commands inside your build directory, after running cmake
#      or configure script (replace X.Y.Z by WeeChat Relay version):
#
#      $ cygport weechat-relay-X.Y.Z-1.cygport fetch
#      $ cygport weechat-relay-X.Y.Z-1.cygport almostall
#
#      Packages are built in directory: ./weechat-relay-X.Y.Z-1.<arch>/dist/weechatrelay/
